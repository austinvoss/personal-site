    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>Hello, my name is Voss. I'm a passionate full-stack software engineer with a love for problem-solving and creating innovative solutions. I am currently honing my skills in a full-stack software engineer bootcamp, and I'm excited to apply what I've learned in real-world projects.</p>
    
    <h2>Background</h2>
    
    <p>My journey into software development began when I started working with a loved one to apply an autoimmune protocol (diet) to address their health challenges. Soon after, I helped a friend with a similar diet following complications from surgery. Recognizing the potential to make a positive impact, I taught myself HTML, CSS, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails to build an app that made planning meals on the protocol easier.</p>
    
    <p>The app utilized a user-friendly interface and incorporated real-world or practical measurements for foods, such as "1/2 avocado" or "1 fillet of salmon" instead of grams, making it simpler for users to plan their meals. After the success of this app, I started a business to share it with the world. I initially worked with clients directly through phone consultations, but later automated the process to guide clients through a 21-day diet program.</p>
    
    <p>The app was used by thousands of people, leading to improvements in heart health, weight loss, reduced epileptic seizures, and heightened presence in autistic individuals. The income from this app allowed me to travel throughout Southeast Asia for a year, further fueling my passion for creating meaningful solutions through technology.</p>
    
    <h2>Interests</h2>
    
    <p>Outside of coding, I have a wide range of interests that have helped me become a well-rounded individual. Some of my hobbies include:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Free Diving</strong>: I enjoy exploring the underwater world, swimming with sharks and barracudas, and observing the fascinating aquatic wildlife up close.</li>
      <li><strong>Traveling & Exploring New Cuisines</strong>: I love visiting new countries and indulging in their unique culinary experiences, as it helps me broaden my perspectives and appreciate different cultures.</li>
      <li><strong>Immersing in New Cultures</strong>: Through my travels, I've learned to embrace and appreciate the diversity of our world, which has enriched my life in many ways.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Skills and Expertise</h2>
    
    <p>Throughout my bootcamp experience and personal projects, I've developed a strong skill set that includes:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Front-End Development</strong>: Proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and frameworks like React.js and Next.js.</li>
      <li><strong>Back-End Development</strong>: Skilled in Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and Flask.</li>
      <li><strong>Version Control</strong>: Comfortable using Git and managing projects on GitHub.</li>
      <li><strong>Agile Methodologies</strong>: Experienced in working with Agile development practices and Scrum framework.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Personal Values</h2>
    
    <p>I firmly believe that empathy, teamwork, and a strong work ethic are essential qualities in a software engineer. I'm dedicated to continuous learning and improvement, and I'm eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals to create exceptional products and services.</p>
